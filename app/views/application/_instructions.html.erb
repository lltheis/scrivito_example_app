      <p class="collapse in" id="bar-left">
        On the left of the editing panel, there is the <b>working copy menu</b>. With Scrivito,
        all changes are made inside of a working copy. The changes are only visible to the editor
        who made them and to other editors that have been invited to the working copy. Since you
        are the only editor of this demo you cannot invite other editors. The working copy menu
        lets you switch between different working copies and publish, rename etc. the currently
        selected one. In this demo, you can create up to three working copies.

        In the center of the editing bar, there is the <b>view mode selector</b>. You can switch
        between preview mode, editing mode, and the changes view. Remember that the
        <em>Published content</em> is not editable. Thus, you need to select or create a
        working copy when switching to editing mode while the published content is being viewed.

      On the right of the editing bar, you have <b>the content browser, the preview size selector,
      and the page menu</b> buttons. The content browser is for browsing and selecting content
      objects, e.g. the image an image widget should display. The preview size selector lets you
      choose from several widths for the display of the content preview. Scrivito creates
      responsive content out of the box, and you can always proof read in different target browser
      sizes. The page menu offers actions related to the current page.

    Creating pages made easy

      <p>
        There are several options when making pages editable in place with Scrivito. Which ones
        you choose depends on the amount of freedom and the amount of convenience you want to give
        to your editors.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this demo, we just applied a simple pre-built Bootstrap theme and showcase some of the
        widgets we've created using basic bootstrap components. This is what you get out of the
        box after having completed the default Scrivito integration procedure.
      </p>

      <p>
        Of course you can select for your editors a different subset of the standard widgets or
        add other widgets you can create in your app or include from RubyGems.org.

        You can <b>have your application render basic content on a page</b> and offer editors to
        create additional content in specific page sections. This introduction page mainly
        consists of &quot;static&quot; content that cannot be changed by an editor. Thus, the
        introductory text cannot be deleted. But, at the end of the page, there is a section that
        can be modified by editors using Scrivito.

      <p>
        You can create <b>page &quot;templates&quot; specifying a predefined structure</b> your
        editors simply fill with the content they provide. The blog pages have been built this
        way. For every blog post, editors simply fill out some fields such as <em>title</em>,
        <em>tags</em>, etc. Then they provide the body of the blog post by utilizing Scrivito's
        headline, text or image widgets.  Take a look at the blog included in this demo.

        Free-form with widgets

      <p>
        You can also create <b>&quot;blank&quot; page templates</b> in which you render just a
        single Scrivito <em>widgetlist</em> attribute that editors may freely populate with the
        widgets you provide.  The pages in the <em>Sample Pages&nbsp;&amp; Widgets</em> menu in
        the top navigation bar are
        such free-form pages.
