Scrivito includes a flexible Column widget. The number of columns as well as the width of each of
them is configurable via the &quot;Widget properties&quot; view. Since we are using Bootstrap, there is an
underlying grid of 12 columns you can freely allocate, with the exception that the width of the
rightmost column is automatically set to the number of grid columns not used by the other widget
columns. You can remove an empty column by setting its width to zero. Applying this to a non-empty
column sets its width to one grid column, so you can still access its content.

In the examples below, we've already placed a Text widget into each column. Feel free to populate
them with further widgets!
